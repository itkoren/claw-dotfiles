# My OpenClaw Dot Files Automation Management Repository


## 🗿 Overview

This [claw-dotfiles](https://github.com/itkoren/claw-dotfiles) repository is managed with [`chezmoi🏠`](https://www.chezmoi.io/), a great dotfiles manager.
The setup scripts are aimed for [MacOS](https://www.apple.com/jp/macos). It include settings for OpenClaw installation `client` machines. 

The actual dotfiles exist under the [`home`](https://github.com/itkoren/claw-dotfiles/tree/master/home) directory specified in the [`.chezmoiroot`](https://github.com/itkoren/claw-dotfiles/blob/master/.chezmoiroot).
See [.chezmoiroot - chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/reference/special-files-and-directories/chezmoiroot/) more detail on the setting.

## 📥 Setup

To set up the dotfiles run the appropriate snippet in the terminal.

### 💻 `MacOS`

- Configuration snippet of the Apple Silicon MacOS environment for client macnine:

```console
bash -c "$(curl -fsLS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itkoren/claw-dotfiles/main/setup.sh)"
```

### Minimal setup

The following is a minimal setup command to install chezmoi and my dotfiles from the github repository on a new empty machine:

> sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)" -- init itkoren --apply

## ⚙️ Install & Setup Application Individually

This repository provides for the installation and setup of each application individually.
The desired application can be installed as follows (e.g., docker installation on MacOS):

```shell
bash install/macos/common/docker.sh
```

Each installation script can be found under the [`./install`](https://raw.githubusercontent/itkoren/claw-dotfiles/main/install) directory.

## 🛠️ Update & Test 🧪

Updating and testing the dotfiles follows [chezmoi's daily operations](https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/daily-operations/).
To verify that the updated scripts work correctly, run the scripts on the actual local machine and on the docker container.

### 💡 Develop the Setup Scripts

The setup scripts are stored as shellscripts in an appropriate location under the [`./install`](https://raw.githubusercontent/itkoren/claw-dotfiles/main/install) directory.
After verifying that the shellscript works, store the [chezmoi template](https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/templating/)-based file, which is based on the shellscript, in an appropriate location under the [`./home/.chezmoiscripts`](https://raw.githubusercontent/itkoren/claw-dotfiles/main/home/.chezmoiscripts) directory.

Below is the correspondence between shellscript and template for docker installation on MacOS.
- The shellscript for docker: [`install/macos/common/docker.sh`](https://raw.githubusercontent/itkoren/claw-dotfiles/main/install/macos/common/docker.sh)
- The chezmoi template for docker: [`home/.chezmoiscripts/macos/run_once_10-install-docker.sh.tmpl`](https://raw.githubusercontent/itkoren/claw-dotfiles/main/home/.chezmoiscripts/macos/run_once_10-install-docker.sh.tmpl)

### 💾 Test on the Local Machine

Currently, chezmoi does not automatically reflect updated configuration files (ref. [twpayne/chezmoi#2738](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/discussions/2738)).
The following command will execute the [`chezmoi apply`](https://www.chezmoi.io/reference/commands/apply/) command as soon as the file is modified using [`watchexec`](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec).

```shell
make watch
```

The chezmoi documentation mentions automatica application by [`watchman`](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/). 
See [https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/advanced/use-chezmoi-with-watchman/](https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/advanced/use-chezmoi-with-watchman/) for more detail.

### 🐳 Test on Docker Container

Test the executation of the setup scripts on Ubuntu in its initial state.
The following command will launch the test environment using Docker 🐳.

```shell
make docker

# docker run -it -v "$(pwd):/home/$(whoami)/.local/share/chezmoi" dotfiles /bin/bash --login
# itkoren@5f93d270cb51:~$ 
```

Run the [`chezmoi init --apply`](https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/setup/#use-a-hosted-repo-to-manage-your-dotfiles-across-multiple-machines) command to verify that the system is set up correctly.

```shell
itkoren@5f93d270cb51:~$ chezmoi init --apply
```

### 🦇 Unit Test with [Bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) [![Unit test](https://raw.githubusercontent/itkoren/claw-dotfiles/main/actions/workflows/test.yaml/badge.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent/itkoren/claw-dotfiles/main/actions/workflows/test.yaml)

Test the shellscript for setup with [Bash Automated Testing System (bats)](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core).
The scripts for the unit test can be found under [`./tests`](https://raw.githubusercontent/itkoren/claw-dotfiles/main/tests/install) directory.
